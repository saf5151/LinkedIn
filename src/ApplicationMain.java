 *
 * ApplicationMain will serve as the entry point to our LinkedIn application in the final implementation.  This
 * iteration is a simplified version that shows Java code to connect to the database and execute a few queries.
 * The database was build outside of this file, and will be provided in the submission.  The SQL queries to construct
 * the database will also be provided in the file "db_schema.txt". For more examples of the SQL queries we plan
 * to implement, including some more complex ones, see section 3.1 of our application write-up.
